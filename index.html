<h1>
The Royal Music Tour 
</h1>
(BB Queen and The Broccoli Smuggler)

We’re a janky DJ duo in a converted Royal Mail van with a mission to deliver good vibes across Europe.

England, France Spain – so far we’ve delivered Aperol Spritz and jazz in Devon, a seaside picnic and after party in St-Aubin-Sur-Mer and a cliff-top rave to Spain’s El Capitan.


<h2>Bookings</h2>
Having a party, a picnic or a festival? We can bring the whole van shebang to you, fully solar powered with DJs, speakers, and an Espresso Martini or two. Book us.


<h2>Deliveries</h2>
Want a tune, cup of Yorkshire tea or a home-made Espresso Martini delivered to someone this side of the world? When on tour we love bringing personalised sets/surprises to friends of friends. Email us.
