France – it’s more than excellent wine, cheese and bread. There’s also pastis, rugged coast lines, brilliant walks, runs, free vanlife camping and well, the French. And the French way of life. 

So far we’ve found a couple of interesting differences. See, where the English have barriers, the French have bare cliffs. No signage, no fences. Want to be a silly git? Go on. Probably how they invented base jumping.

Some places have smoking areas, the French call it France. Smoke freely and suavely. Just don’t breathe too much during sets.

Where New Zealand has extortionate prices for bottles of their own wine, the French don’t. Yay. Seriously, NZ wineries, sort that out.

And the French aren’t stuck up. They don’t care who you are or if you’re not French (or speak amateur-hour French). We’ve found they are genuinely interested and generous, offering meals, hot showers, and great stories while you park your van at their house.

In terms of #vanlife, there are recycling stations on every corner and public toilets in every town. They may be squats, but we’re getting epic quads.

There are also ‘gratuit parking’ spots left, right and far out on seaside clifftops. They make you think of the South Island of NZ a bit. These spots leave ‘a room with a view Airbnb’ type places in the dust.

And to get a bit dusty, you find wine at $4 per litre (decent wine – and that’s converted into NZD). Local cheese like camembert or chevre (goat’s) for max $2 (again, NZD) and beautiful, freshly baked bread for about $1.50.

Every town, no matter how small, has a patisserie or boulangerie. They’re generally open from 7am until about 1pm and again from 3pm until 5pm or so, for us late brunchers.

There’s also a shop kind of like a dairy – but in France it’s not chips, pies and soft drinks stuffing the shelves. It’s colourfully laid out veg, fresh fruit, cheese cut from a round and locally produced cider and wine. We like dairies with wine (England’s offies were legit too).

The French also have a drinking culture. It’s a wine at the beach, a small beer pre-lunch at 11,30am. It’s considered, cool, not to excess but exquisitely appropriate. 

So France is the first country after England on this trip, and everyone knew it’d be great to suss the famous cheese (and wine) adoration that’s going on here. 

But France is legit. We didn’t expect this country (and the people) to host us like the most. Turns out we like France and we like the French – even more than their cheese and wine.
