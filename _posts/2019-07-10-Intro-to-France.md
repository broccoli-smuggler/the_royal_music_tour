This country has more than excellent wine, cheese and bread. There’s also pastis, rugged coast lines, they have dolphins across the channel, brilliant walks, runs, free camping spots and the French (and the French way of life).

We crossed over from Newhaven to Dieppe and come down the French coast a bit. So far a few things struck us, like where the English have barriers, the French have bare cliffs. No signage, no fences. Want to be a silly git? Go on (it’s probably how they invented base jumping).

Some countries have smoking areas, the French call it France. Smoke freely and suavely, just don’t breathe too much during sets. Somehow they still make it look cool, but naturally I’m not condoning it (don’t smoke, kids).

Where New Zealand has extortionate prices for bottles of their own wine, the French don’t. Yay. Seriously, NZ wineries, sort that out.

And the French aren’t stuck up. They don’t care who you are or if you’re not French (or speak amateur-hour French). We’ve found they are genuinely interested and generous, offering meals, hot showers, and great stories while you park your van at their house. They're also surprisingly helpful and patient if you're learning French.

In terms of #vanlife, there are recycling stations on every corner and public toilets in every town. They may be squats, but we’re getting epic quads. 

There are also ‘gratuit parking’ spots left, right and far out on seaside clifftops. They make you think of the South Island of New Zealand a bit. To date we’ve woken up overlooking beaches, castles and stunning lakes. It leaves a ‘room with a view Airbnb’ type place in the dust.

And to get a bit dusty, you find wine at $4 per litre (decent wine – and that’s converted into NZD). Local cheese like camembert or chevre (goat’s) for max $2 (again, NZD) and beautiful, freshly baked bread for about $1.50.

Every town, no matter how small, has a boulangerie and a coiffure. These people have their priorities down: Good bread, good hair. Shops open at 7am and close at 1pm for a long lunch, then open again from 3pm until 5pm, perfect for a late brunch.

There’s also a shop kind of like a dairy – but in France it’s not chips, pies and soft drinks stuffing the shelves. It’s colourfully laid out veg, fresh fruit, cheese cut from a round and locally produced cider and wine. We like dairies with wine (England’s offies were legit too).

The French also have a drinking culture. It’s a wine at the beach, a small beer pre-lunch at 11,30am. It’s considered, cool, not to excess but exquisitely appropriate. 

For example, at the Pete The Monkey festival we went to, the vibe was super friendly, not hectic or over the top, just a really creative, outgoing and welcoming group of people. We had no trouble meeting some brilliant Parisians, getting invited to play at the after party and getting a crowd along to an impromptu beach set. Good vibes.

In addition, the music is on point. These guys are into their brass bands like no tomorrow and they are banging. I saw at least one band at every stage that got the crowd bopping, from afro house to funk, alternative, disco, cheese, even some DJs working Bollywood into their sets and killing it.

So France is the first country after England on this trip, and everyone knew it’d be great to suss my somewhat famous cheese (and wine) obsession, and there was no way Pete The Monkey lineup was going to disappoint.

But what we didn’t expect was that the people here would be so utterly generous and host us like the most. Turns out we like France and we like the French – even more than their cheese and wine.
