Morning chat over Mimosas in Chevon, France.

We have a fly in the van and this is not our idea of a van pet.

Josh doesn’t like flies. In fact he has a strong hatred for them, he even prefers sandflies.

The cool thing about sandflies is you can make them pop. (I thought this was only mosquitoes but Joshua assures me that if you squeeze your skin when a sandfly bites, it explodes. Toby does it all the time.)

Like “Yum, yum…too much! But still yum… and then aaargh – boom!”

Kind of like a heroin addict. Or an obese person.

Now we’re wondering if obese people ever pop.
