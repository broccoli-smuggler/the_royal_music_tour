**Pre-loading**

We took the scenic route to le monkey’s lair. The ferry was a fun form of transport but rather uneventful.

Arrival to the cute town of Dieppe quickly coincided with a trip to our trusty Lidl. After a raptuous cheese adoration session we were all set to wine, dine and have a smashing afterparty at Pete’s. 

Our goals were simple: French friends, good tunes and a chance to give le van a proper inaugueration party, champers and all.

Our ability to make French friends was quickly made challenging. Instead of being allowed into camping proper we were ushered to the corner of the carpark, away from anything that could be encouraged to bop to our shiny speakers.

Sadenned but undeterred, we finished the cider and packed our bag to make the trek in. The queue to get in was small. Yay, skipping the camping did have some benefits. Unfortunately that’s when the fun stopped. Security took a dislike to my teapot that I’d bought in as my drinking vessel. My astonishment, exasterbated by the cider, did not get anything but a ‘non’ from the guard as to the reason for my rejection. 

Back to le van again. 

We fortified afresh to help with my sudden loss and grief and went back in. A little deflated it must be said.

Past the security and we’re in. Woop woo.

Almost.

A French lad by the name of Dimitri stopped us. He informed us that he was one of the management types at the festival. He was confused that we were camping in the arse end of nowhere and suggested maybe we’d prefer a waterside spot. Right by the beach. We like Dimitri.

Arriving at the beach we were hailed by some chaps in a van with an a+, once in a lifetime spot on the promenade. They were looking for some more people to make their kinda, not really a proper camping spot, more legit through numbers. Our sort of people. This crew managed to completely reverse the stereotype of stuck-up Parisians who can’t be arsed with anyone not from Paris. Apart from being ‘tres cool’ of course (\*).

We entered The Monkey, three hours after we arrived, faffing finally completed with a bunch of new French friends in tow. Classic Bibi-Josh.

\* NZ has a scale of things: chill to hectic (thanks to the Dogtown boys for this one). As in, woh, that’s hectic. Or, that wave was super chill. I believe it’s particularly prevalent in the surfer/climber crew. France’s equivilent scale is tres cool to non cool. Tres cool: Pete the Monkey, endless wine on the beach, Cabaret at the secret stage. Non cool: Avocados flown from Chilli, two day hangovers, East France.

**Day 1 – Thursday**

Entering the Monkey it was immediately apparent that these guys knew what they were doing. The layout was inviting, encouraging meandering from stage to stage. Little things like having a DJ play some cheeky tunes at the food stalls as soon as the main stage was finished. Keeping people bopping along to their next destination.

The art was fantastic. The cheeky cartooney style of the whole event really made the vibe. Bananas, monkeys and heels galore. Aided by the lack of advertising really made the place feel super welcoming. Somewhere between Splore and a burn for you Kiwis reading.

The first night was spent wondering around exploring. There were loads of little nooks and crannies holding surprises. One artist had hooked up live plants with touch sensitive leaves that played music as you touched them. 

Of course we didn’t spend the whole time in hippy-stroking-tree-art-wank mode. The excellent Camion Bazar, a mobile sound group from Paris, soon dragged us in their direction. The tunes were deep, exotic, fun and funky. The highest of compliments. We ended up there an alarming amount during the weekend and may be the reason I remember shockingly little of who I saw playing.

The first night was rounded up with a DJ called Blackmix before Bibi unusually piked at 3am. Don’t worry, she was very disappointed and determinedly remedied it the rest of the nights. I followed her after discovering the presence of two additional stages we hadn’t seen. A silent Disco and the hidden Cabaret stage that wasn’t on any of the maps. Tres cool.

**Day 2 – Friday**

Waking up to the sounds of the waves and the murmurs of our french campervan mates enjoying the first wine of the long day was a pleasure. The hot tin van less so, but a quick trip to the English channel sorted that out.

Minimising our faff we actually got into the festival before sunset. We were in time to see “the grass band” a walking brass band in all their glory, belting out bangers to all. These guys were so good. So so good. Rumour has it that the last night of the festival these guys got 150+ people down in the surf as they played half submerged as the sun rose. Good lads.
 
We then entered the delightful crafts area. Deciding that pottery may be a craft a step too far we settled for making nipple pasties. I somehow managed to wrangle a switch, I’ll do yours if you do mine. This resulted in the rest of the evening being half party party dance dance and half nipple model. Pro tip. Always get the art student to do your festival crafting. 

6pm rolled round which meant that we had a sunset party at the beach with our French friends and their friends and in the end random locals, complete with wheelchairs spinning around to tunes in the sun. The royal music tour really had begun. The mad dream of living our life in an art car had become a reality. It was truly a special moment. You can see me here looking pretty special.

Wrapping up our little pre-load drinks with too much pastis we headed back into the festival. We caught the last song of the Mauskovic dance band, who were one of the reasons we choose this festival. It was banging. The pastis was working well. After that it was off to the secret Caberet stage where some hilariously racy French people were doing their thing. Absolute highlight.

After that it gets a bit hazy. Excellent DJ’s. Bibi had a 40 min thumb war with an English lad which, annoyingly given her unatural ability, she lost. More DJ’s. 5am. Oh, the festival is finished. Luckily we had a plan.

The afterparty was amazing. Playing Elizabeth in all her glory to the rising sun and the ragtag bunch of French we’d coerced along. Pastis and skinnydipping all round.

**Day 3 – Saturday**

The last day was serious struggle street. The only thing that managed to drag us out was the heat. The baking mid-afternoon sun, as well as the impromptu vintage photoshoot by our van friends. They assured us it was for their clothes store website. I remain unconvinced that it wasn’t French softcore porno. I’ll let you be the judge.

The festival continued it’s delights with some more groovy tunes from the likes of Moussa and Papooz. Papooz, were having a cracking time, off their tits. Culminating in them inviting the crowd on-stage for one of their rowdier surf songs. However, the lead singer got a bit panicky at the stage’s alarming wobble, and had to try to usher them all back off. It was off to the silent disco for a bit of cheese and finally round the night off with some short films in a makeshift cinema. They were great, brilliantly done and gave me insight to French film makers’ thinking. It’s mainly sex and incest. Oh and spaghetti westerns.

At around 1am Bibi and I were going to call it a night, still pretty shattered from previous nights bopping. It was then we were informed, much to our horror, that the festival ended 5am. No Sunday. We’re not in little NZ any more, these people having resting to do on Sunday. Horrific FOMO kept us going to see the festival out. Turns out the French finish a festival with cheesy disco. Everywhere. On all the stages. Tres cool (?).

**Day 3+ - Sunday**

We said goodbyes, exchanged details and promised to meet in Paris. Wondering down to the local seaside cafe for a beer and wifi we bumped into two cheeky older fellows getting merrily drunk. After swapping tales they invited us back for a shower and some hot food. We excitedly agreed. Bibi would, at this point, have forgone cheese for a whole day to get a shower.

However it was not to be. Instead the festival organiser, Robert, who had seen our daytime party, and had our email due to Bibi’s super socialising, was keen to comandeer our rig for the afterparty of Pete the Monkey. Which is how we ended up DJ’ing the packdown afterparty for all the crew. Who were, obviously, all grand.

**Day 3++ - Monday**

We thought it would be nice the next day to help a bit with cleanup. Pick up all the confetti. Rake the dirt. That sort of thing. Robert had other ideas. He wanted to throw another little surprise for the crew. This involved afternoon goon, cheese and a beachside set with le van. Another win for having a ridiculously great time.

Turns out you can fit twelve French people chanting loudly, a bike and a lot of goon in Elizabeth. We found this out as we bounced along to Robert’s dad’s house. We finished our Pete story being fed incredible food on a forty person table by the fire. 

We had hoped to make a couple of friends, and hear some great music. We certainly didn’t think we’d end up in the Monkey’s lair. Meeting the amazing humans that make this very special, delightful festival possible. 

Tres tres cool.

I need sleep..
