We took the scenic route to Le Monkey’s lair. The ferry was a fun form of transport but rather uneventful.

Arrival to the cute town of Dieppe quickly coincided with a trip to our trusty Lidl. After a raptuous cheese adoration session we were all set to wine, dine and have a smashing afterparty at Pete’s. 

Our goals were simple: French friends, good tunes and a chance to give le van a proper inaugueration party, champers and all.

Our ability to make French friends was quickly made challenging. Instead of being allowed into camping proper we were ushered to the corner of the carpark, away from anything that could be encouraged to bop to our shiny speakers.

Sadenned but undeterred, we finished the cider and packed our bag to make the trek in. The queue to get in was small, benefits of not lining up for the campground. Woop woop.

Unfortunately that’s when the fun stopped. Security took a dislike to my teapot, brought in as my drinking vessel. And to my cider fuelled astonishment, refused it entry. Nothing but a ‘non’ from the guard for an explanation. 

Back to le van again. 

We fortified afresh to help with my sudden loss and grief and went back in. A little deflated, it must be said.

Past the security and we’re in. Woop woop woo.

Almost.

A French lad by the name of Dimitri stopped us. He informed us that he was one of the management types at the festival. He was confused that we were camping in the arse end of nowhere and suggested maybe we’d prefer a waterside spot. Beachside. We like Dimitri.

Arriving at the beach we were hailed by some chaps in a van with an a+, once in a lifetime spot on the promenade. They were looking for some additional reprobates to make their not really a proper camping spot, more legit through numbers. Our sort of people. This crew of Parisianss managed to completely reverse the stereotype. Welcoming, warm and not at all stuck up. They were 'tres cool' though, so some stereotypes still hold. (\*).

We entered The Monkey, three hours after we arrived, faffing finally completed with a bunch of French friends in tow. Classic Bibi-Josh.

\* NZ has a scale of things: chill to hectic (thanks to the Dogtown boys for this one). As in, woah, that’s hectic. Or, that wave was super chill. I believe it’s particularly prevalent in the surfer/climber crew. France’s equivalent scale is tres cool to non cool. Tres cool: Pete the Monkey, endless wine on the beach, Cabaret at the secret stage. Non cool: Avocados flown from Chilli, two day hangovers, East France.

**Day 1 – Thursday**

It was immediately apparent that these guys knew what they were doing. Little things like having a DJ play some cheeky tunes at the food stalls as soon as the main stage was finished. Keeping us bopping along to our next destination.

The art was fantastic. Bananas, monkeys and heels galore. Aided by the lack of advertising or commercialism really made for a really homegrown personal vibe. Somewhere between Splore and Kiwiburn - high praise indeed.

The first night was spent exploring. There were nooks and crannies abound holding surprises. One artist had hooked up live plants with sensitive leaves that played music as you touched them. 

Of course we didn’t spend the whole time in hippy-stroking-tree-art-wank mode. The excellent Camion Bazar, a mobile sound group from Paris, soon dragged us in their direction. The tunes were deep, exotic, fun and funky. The highest of compliments. We ended up there an alarming amount and may be the reason I remember shockingly little of who I saw playing.

The first night was rounded up with a DJ called Blackmix before Bibi unusually piked at 3am. Don’t worry, she was very disappointed and determinedly remedied it the rest of the nights. I followed her after discovering the presence of two additional stages we hadn’t seen. A silent Disco and the hidden Cabaret stage that wasn’t on any of the maps.


**Day 2 – Friday**

Waking up to the sounds of the waves and the murmurs of our french campervan mates enjoying the first wine of the long day was a pleasure. The hot tin van less so, but a quick trip to the channel sorted that out. 

Minimising our faff we actually got into the festival before sunset. Just in time to see “the grass band” a walking brass band in all their glory, belting out bangers to all. These guys were so good. So so good. Rumour has it that the last night of the festival they got 150+ people down in the surf as they played half submerged as the sun rose. Good lads.

We then entered the delightful crafts area. Deciding that pottery may be a wee bit ambitious, we settled for making nipple pasties. I somehow managed to wrangle a switch, I’ll do yours if you do mine. This resulted in spending the rest of the evening as a sideshow attraction for people. Pro tip. Always get the creative, aka bibi, to do your festival crafting. Here's me looking pretty special.

6pm rolled round which meant sunset parties at the beach with our van neighbours, their friends and some random locals. Who arrived complete with wheelchairs to spin around in time with the tunes in the sun. The royal music tour had begun. The mad dream of living our life in an art car had become a reality. It was a special moment.

Wrapping up our little pre-drinks with too much wine, we headed back into the festival. We caught the last song of the Mauskovic dance band, who were a big draw for this festival. It was banging. The vin was working well. After that it was off to the secret Caberet stage where some hilariously racy French people were doing their singalong drag queen thing. Absolute highlight. Unfortunately I only have a picture from afar.

After that it gets a bit hazy. Excellent DJ’s. Bibi had a 40 min thumb war with an English lad which, annoyingly given her unatural ability, she lost. More excellent DJ’s. 5am. And oh, the festival is finished.

Luckily we had a plan.

Playing Elizabeth in all her glory to the rising sun and the ragtag bunch of French we’d coerced along completed a wicked day. Mimosas and skinnydipping all round.

**Day 3 – Saturday**

The last day was serious struggle street. The only thing that managed to drag us out was the heat. The baking mid-afternoon sun, as well a impromptu vintage photoshoot by our van friends. They assured us it was for their clothes store website. I remain unconvinced it wasn’t French softcore porno. I’ll let you be the judge.

The festival continued its delights with some more groovy tunes from the likes of Moussa and Papooz. Papooz, were having a cracking time - off their tits. Culminating in them inviting the crowd on-stage for one of their rowdier surfy songs. However, the lead singer got a bit panicky at the stage’s alarming wobble with the enthusiastic jumping of the crowd and had to usher them all back off. Look them up, or better yet go see them live (there spotify songs don't do them justice).

After, it was off to the silent disco for a big slice of cheese. Bibi first experience of one. After intially doubting the choice of music, she succumbed to hits from aqua, Brittany Spears, and all the classic singalongs. I can confirm she knows the lyrics to *all* guilty pleasures. We round off the night with short films in a makeshift cinema. They were funny and bizzare - purposefully bad 3d animation of the gospel of sodom. Really gave me insight to French haute culture. It’s mainly sex and incest. Oh and spaghetti westerns.

At around 1am, crashing from previous nights bopping, we attempted to call it a night. We were then informed, much to our horror, that the festival ended 5am. No Sunday. These people having resting to do Sunday. Mortified, the FOMO kept us going to see the festival out. Turns out the French finish a festival with disco. Everywhere. On all the stages. Tres cool (?).

**Day 3+ - Sunday**

We said goodbyes, exchanged details and promised to meet again in Paris. Wondering down to the local seaside cafe for a beer and wifi we bumped into two cheeky older fellows getting merrily drunk. After swapping tales they invited us back for a shower and some hot food. We excitedly agreed. Bibi would have, I think, forgone cheese for a whole day if it resukted in a shower.

It was not to be. Instead the festival organiser, Robert, who had seen our daytime party, and had our email due to Bibi’s super socialising, was keen to comandeer our rig for the afterparty of Pete The Monkey. Which is how we ended up DJ’ing packdown for all the crew. I mean, does it get any better?

**Day 3++ - Monday**

The next day we helped a with cleanup. Pick up all the confetti. Rake the dirt. Die in the sun. That sort of thing. 

Robert had other ideas. He wanted to throw another little surprise for his crew. This involved afternoon goon, cheese and a beachside set with le van. At this point The Royal Music was basically touring.

Turns out, you can fit twelve French people chanting loudly, a bike and a lot of goon in Elizabeth. We found this out as we bounced along to Robert’s dad’s house. We finished our Pete story being fed incredible food on a forty person table by the fire. 

We had hoped to make a couple of friends and hear great music - we did. 

What we weren't expecting was that we’d end up in the Monkey’s lair. Meeting the amazing humans that make this very [special, delightful festival](https://petethemonkeyfestival.org/en) possible.

Tres tres cool.

I need sleep..
