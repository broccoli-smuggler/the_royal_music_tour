On 4 August, my brother Daniel took his own life. 

The day of his funeral, these were my words. 



Before I begin my eulogy, there is something important to address. I want to address it now.

It’s the enormous breed of white elephant that lives in this room today, and in many rooms in many homes across this country. Because of the rate of alcohol abuse and suicide in New Zealand, you all know someone who is a victim to it.

Who’s lives have been ruined by it, to varying degrees.

Daniel’s death was a suicide. An accidental suicide.

An alcohol fueled accident.

We need to talk about this. About alcohol abuse and suicide and stop hiding these problems. Start listening, really listening to those close to us.

And empower them to talk about this issue, to strengthen our friends, families, communities by not keeping this hush. 

Create awareness. 

Consciousness.

Struggling and suicidal people often do not ask for help, but it doesn’t mean they don’t want it. 

If you see a warning sign, feel something is off – or even if you don’t – talk to them, or more importantly listen. Please, please listen. Hard. Intently.
