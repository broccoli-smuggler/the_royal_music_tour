Just before Devon, you get to The World’s End. It’s the only pub stop in these parts, partly because locals don’t rave about their pubs (probably because their own hospitality is that good) and partly as this pub is that good. 

The World's End is full of old pictures of soldiers and newspapers from the 1800s, the beer is flat and the nuts are spicy, and The End Of The World quells our pub thirst for the better part of a week.

It might also be because when you get past The World’s End, you get to Carol and John’s place. Alex said her mum would be delighted with visitors, and even though Carol had no idea who we were, she’d already prepared tea while John plied us with wine and whiskey.

They’re the kind of couple who make you get a bit woozy on the whole happily ever after thing. They recall stories of how they met, she carefully takes him by the arm when they go out, and he’ll slap her cheekily on the bottom as she swans past him back to the liquor cabinet. 

Devon’s pretty and quaint, its white cottages posing with thatched roofs and pink flowers. It's the most superb sunshine on rolling hills cliché and has 10/10 cornfield frolicking opportunities, made better with the solar panels charging the Denon and speakers to full bore.

Not much in the way of restaurants or pubs, the one pub in the village has new, unfriendly owners apparently. Still, we’re stoked because we’re staying in Chapel House with old family friends, the Toops.

So a) We get the Angela Toop’s spectacular hospitality. Fresh 12/10 Mediterranian salads, crispy lemon-ey buttery potatoes and asparagus pie that puts New Zealand’s pie game to shame. 

b) Phil Toop drinks NZ wine and we’re good because Lidl’s budget Aperol alternative is a winner. Biterol, kids. Biterol.

In-between Carol and John's and the Toops' is Durdle Door, on the Jurassic Coast. The name comes from Jurassic Park. It's absolutely stunning and a prime swimming spot. The hills are decked out with wild flowers, straight from some Jane Austen novel. Just ask Josh's mum.

I never got the gardening gene – wouldn’t know a geranium from, well, anything else green – but Devon does flowers and gardens like Winston Peters does himself. Polished, overly well made up, not a hair or blade of grass out of place. These peoples’ gardens are meticulously manicured. 

Their raspberries and strawberries are so tasty, not like those paley, watery ones in the supermarket. These are tiny bites of sweet juicy goodness that make you want to eat so many you’re that kid with a stomach ache because you ate too many.

To digress from food, the people in Devon are mint too. Naturally the Toops are outstanding, quality humans – not only are they dog people – Rebecca flew from Glasgow just for the weekend. It was emotional.

Not emotional but also good, the MOT guy at the garage squished us in and given no time at all, handed out an MOT with puny bill that can’t have covered his time let alone parts and MOT. Plus, when buying a secondhand surfboard the guy throws in a boardbag and a bunch of free camping spots to boot.  

So, Devon gets a solid 13/10 for people, 12/10 for food, and all the things really because we now have an MOT and a whole year of (legal) vanlife ahead.

Yessss. Let’s go.
