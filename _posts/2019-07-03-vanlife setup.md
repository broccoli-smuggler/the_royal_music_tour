First up, the previous owners did a pretty sick job converting this van. While the outside is a tad beaten up, the interior is built in the most efficient way for the size of the van. A big kitchen/living room, raised bed sideways (ideal for us small humans) and storage underneath. There's even soft-close cabinetry. Ha.

The van came with almost everything: A bed, magnetised blackout curtains, lights, crockery, cutlery, plates, pots, collapsing water containers, table, chairs, alcohol breathaliser kits and a first aid kit... the list goes on. 

Friends who were leaving to go back to NZ gave us new pillows and sheets, towels, tea and Pic's peanut butter. Alex and Inga, you're bloody legends.

That leaves basic set up costs, including:

It does seem like a lot, but this is our home for the next six months. And what's a home without loud noise on tap?


**The solar set up:**

Josh did the hard work on this. We both discussed and researched panels and decided on bendy light ones that affix to the roof, and Josh being the engineer got the thing going. A post on the techy stuff coming very soon, promise.

In short, we glued 300 Watts of solar power (three 100W panels) to the roof and attached them to two house batteries that sit under the passenger seat. These power our 3kW inverter - more than enough power for our DJ system and a fridge, chargers, etc.

**Insurance:**

This is a bit tricky. You can’t legally drive a vehicle without insurance in the UK. Also, you can’t legally buy a vehicle in the UK unless you’re a resident (or at least have a residential address). Josh’s Uncle and Aunt to the rescue (thank you, Greg and Jenny).

Insurance is bloody pricey with a NZ driver's license. DownUnder Insurance ended up sussing it and for $880 we got third party cover across Europe for 6 months. Ouch.

**Bikes:**

An absolute essential, obviously, and the Diss auction just out of Norwich is the place to get bikes. About $100 later an 80s retro racer and a vintage 60s step-over in British racing green are mounted to the back of the van (yep, bike racks were included). No shit - in London, bikes save you upwards of ten squid ($20) a day on public transport/parking.

**A looming MOT:**

The van's Warrant of Fitness/MOT was up mid-July. Slightly worrying, considering the state of the panelling and a random whistling/crunching noise, not to mention the ferry to France - booked in just a few days.

However, the guys at the garage took pity and $290 later the van is legal with an MOT for another year. Yusss.

Final additions needed: 

A name and a motor mascot or badge to symbolise the beauty that is this beast. Seeing as this Royal Mail van is escorting two aspiring DJs - The Soultan and BB Queen, the name Elizabeth on a Royal Music Tour came naturally. Josh’s uncle decided Elizabeth needed some faith, and affixed a cherub on the bonnet as a royal badge of, well, hope. 

So here’s hoping that this tour and Elizabeth - our mini home, DJ booth and wheels of hope - go the distance.

Fingers firmly crossed, fists pumping.


*Thanks go to Greg and Jenny for supplying exceptional company, gin and tandem bike rides.*
