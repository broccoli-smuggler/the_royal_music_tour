People: 7/5 Stars

We’ve been country vanlifers for a while and we were looking forward to seeing other humans. Our initial perception of Nantes was a sleepy, arty town, so we went out for a romantic pastis. In a classic Josh move, we ended up at a dive bar. 

The only romance that ensued was that between James, the outrageous bar tender, and his patrons. James made sure he didn’t make any money off us. Instead, after a lock-in, enough home-made alcohol to kill a cat and a fourth dance, the locals took us under their wing, excited by their new found kiwis. Josh found bromance:

And Bibi found a better-looking man:

James insisted Bibi take him home. The adventure continued as Jungle, the initial local to invite us in, off his tits, sprinted off into the street merrily. His friend apologized profusely and attempted to chase him. 

The remaining two locals were twins (not confusing at all). One spoke English, the other attempted, only to slip back into rapid fire French. His brother would then remind him that he was, in fact speaking French and that Josh’s desperate ‘oui’s’ didn’t mean he understood anything. It didn’t matter and we went back to theirs to savour their eclectic record collection. 

The twins (we should probably name them, Romain and Thomas) were definitely hosters with the mostest. They convinced us to stay another night, showed us around the city, around Romain’s art studio and introduced us to French lawn games, BBQ cheese and re-introduced us to hot showers. Ah, the love.

Music: 3/5
We met a whole bunch of musicians, Josh jammed, we’ve already mentioned the record collection, there were live street musicians, our only gripe is we didn’t actually see any of these guys play. It was a Monday, we’ll be back for gigs.

Jois de vie: 4.5/5
I mean, we got pretty merry. It was nice going to a chilled BBQ and walking through the city you come across so much art and beer being consumed. They also have an elephant, we like elephants. It was a bit too hot for us, 45 degrees, so we didn’t partake in the bendy football or spend as much time out during the day. Nothing to do with the hangover, honest.

On the ne pas cool to tres cool scale, Nantes sits firmly at the tres cool end. They have an elephant, which is really big and mechanical, kind of like a Burning Man art car thing. It walks around the Nantes island, squirts water at people and is miles better than a big wheel as a tourist attraction. 

Lots of people we met had fallen in love with Nantes too, arriving there one day and then before they knew it they’ve been there eight years. I guess that’s what happens when you meander through cobbled streets, admire all the art, kiss the giant feet of the Nantes elephant and wind up in a local dive bar.
