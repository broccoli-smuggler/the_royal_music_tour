Yay! 

The adventure begins.

First stop is picking up our van from London. In our sensibility we thought that buying a van sight unseen off trade me was a wise way to start our adventure. You know, ride our luck right from the beginning of the trip. 

The current owners were very good at projecting a certain lifestyle in the ebay images. Lot's of twee photos of sunset picnics and views of the water from the van door. A lot less photo's of exterior of the van. The interior of the van. The engine. Luckily we're not complete fools, we saw they had a surfboard in one of the photos. Thus ascertaining their upstanding character we put a bid on a lifestyle.

So why the move? I have to think quite hard on how to answer this. We have an amazing life back in NZ. All the amazing people and an easy lifestyle. My work was doing well, we'd just signed the big contract at my start-up. Possibly leading to a good chance of wealth. To give all this up seemed a little irresponsible and irrational. Yet there is always a sense when you are in NZ that the world is passing you by a little (*1). 



\*1 This may be wrong. NZ certainly has some traits that make it a reasonbly unique place in the world. It is reasonlbly isolated physically which allows unique ideas or systems to develop.
