Yay! The adventure begins.

First stop is picking up our van from London. In our sensibility we thought that buying a van sight unseen off trade me was a wise way to start our adventure. You know, ride our luck right from the beginning of the trip. 

The current owners were very good at projecting a certain lifestyle in the ebay images. Lot's of twee photos of sunset picnics and views of the water from the van door. A lot less photo's of exterior of the van. The interior of the van. The engine. Luckily we're not complete fools, we saw they had a surfboard in one of the photos. Thus ascertaining their upstanding character we put a bid on a dream of a lifestyle.
