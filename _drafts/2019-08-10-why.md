So why the move? 

Well it's hard to really give much of a rational answer to this. I have a great lifestlye in NZ, with nothing to complain about. I really love Auckland, it's a cracking time. The one problem is, what with living a four hour flight from the nearest other landmass, that NZ is isolated. This can be a great thing, there's a lovely naivety and a focus on smakk 

It's hard to answer this properly. We have an amazing life back in NZ. All the amazing people and a great lifestyle. My work was doing well, we'd just signed the 'big contract' at my start-up. However I had felt for a long time, maybe unfairly that the world was passing by. It had also been all a bit too stable and uneventful of late 

In short. I was nearly 30 and needed some more good stories. So chucked it all in, because why not. You don't lose anything making great memories. London with a royal mail van seemed a good start..


\* This may be wrong. NZ certainly has some traits that make it a reasonbly unique place in the world. It is isolated physically, yet well educated and rich with a liberal democratic goverment. The stereotype of NZ's being able to solve problems with scant reasources seems relatively well earned
