<h2> Intro </h2>
In order to power all the silly things in the van we needed power. In particular solar power. This post is a step-by-step guide in how I worked out the approximate power requirements and installed the system onto a van. I think I been about as Dutch as possible and managed to get a 300w system for $1100 NZD. This powers our speakers and denon for around 5 hours on full charge (depending on how loud we're pumping). You'll also find a list of the components I used and the 'gotchas' I came across.

<h2> How much power is too much? </h2>
